## 🤖 LLM Integration

Creators can integrate any AI model into their agents using API keys. These models can be accessed via their official SDKs or HTTP APIs.

## 🔗 Supported LLMs

Agents can connect to models like:

- OpenAI GPT (via OpenAI SDK)

- Anthropic Claude

- Mistral AI

- Google Gemini

- Hugging Face

## 🔑 Using API Keys

LLM integrations require an API key. You can:

Use platform-provided API keys (recommended for ease of use).

Use your own API key if you have an existing subscription.

🛠️ Example: Using OpenAI GPT

```
import openai
import os

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def get_response(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

Ensure your API key is stored securely in your secrets or if using OptimalAgents.ai API-Key, they must be enabled in Creators' secrets manager!

## 🔑 Obtaining API Keys
