## Secrets Manager

Secrets are environment variables required by your agent to function.
These will be passed to the Docker container when the agent runs.
Store them securely in your profile's **Secrets manager**.
To ensure security and functionality, creators must define required environment variables in the agent code.

Please generate your **CREATOR_API_KEY**. This will be required to run any Agent that you have uploaded

By default, we will including **AGENT_ID**, **CREATOR_API_KEY**, **_Secrets_** as environment variables.

Examples include:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key
DB_URL=your_database_url
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

Never hardcode secrets! Load them in your app like this:

```
import os
api_key = os.getenv("CREATOR_API_KEY")
```

Examples include:

```

API_KEY=your_creator_api_key
MODEL_NAME=your_preferred_model
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_url

```

## Secure Storage of Secrets

All Secrets are stored in an encrypted vault using industry-standard encryption algorithms, with access restricted to authorized personnel only.
Database entries containing secrets use column-level encryption to prevent exposure through SQL injection or data leaks.
We recommend implementing a least-privilege access model where microservices access only the specific secrets they require.
